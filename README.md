# Basic Game Input Manager

This is an initial starting point for future projects that will require input for a game. This uses RxJS to handle multiple input sources for a game. This includes arrow keys, WASD, XBox and Playstation controllers.

The relavent files are in [src/app/shared](https://github.com/paulreitz/base_input_manager/tree/main/src/app/shared). The main input controller is in [src/app/shared/services/input.service.ts](https://github.com/paulreitz/base_input_manager/blob/main/src/app/shared/services/input.service.ts).

This makes extensive use of RxJS, have a look: https://rxjs.dev/

Am I just going to copy/paste all of this into future projects? Absolutely! And I'll come back to this to update it if I find any nice optimizations.
